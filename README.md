XcodeSnippets
=============
A collection of my own xcode snippets collected and discovered over time.  
They are installed using the excellent Ruby Gem `xcodesnippets` by Luke Redpath.  
I have added both a full bundle and the individual snippets, so it is possible to install 
all snippets at once, or pick the ones you want to use.

# Getting started

The code snippets uses the Ruby Gem `xcodesnippets` by Luke Redpath. It can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/lukeredpath/xcodesnippets) or installed from the Terminal using
Ruby gem:  
`$ sudo gem install xcodesnippets`
	
## Installing the snippets
* Clone the code snippets
* If you want to install all snippets use the bundle:  
`$ xcodesnippets install-bundle [path-to-snippet-bundle]`
* If you want to install each snippet explicetely use:  
`$ xcodesnippets install [path-to-snippet-file]`
